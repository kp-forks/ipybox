# ipybox

> ipybox

ipybox is a Python code execution sandbox with first-class support for programmatic MCP tool calling.
It generates a typed Python tool API from MCP server tool schemas, supporting both local stdio and
remote HTTP servers. Code that calls the generated API executes in a sandboxed IPython kernel,
providing a stateful environment where variables and definitions persist across executions. The
generated API delegates MCP tool execution to a separate environment that enforces tool call
approval, requiring applications to explicitly accept or reject each tool call before it executes.
ipybox is designed for agents that interact with their environment through code actions rather
than JSON tool calls, a more reliable approach since LLMs are heavily pretrained on Python code.
